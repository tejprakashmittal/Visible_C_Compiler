# Visible_C_Compiler
A Visualisation Tool For Learning Compiler

The study of the inner-working of a compiler can be greatly made easy through use of a
visible C compiler. A visible C compiler allows close analysis of the compilation process as
“original” program is being compiled.

In this project we present VCC (Visible C Compiler), a tool that visualizes compiler process.

The main objective of the project is to visualize the things that goes under each and every phase
of a basic compiler frontend. Firstly, we are creating a basic model of compiler using existing
compiler GCC, which will show, how exactly a compiler works, how does each phase output look
like?
